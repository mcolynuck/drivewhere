SETTING UP TO USE HEROKU PLATFORM
---------------------------------
Install Heroku toolbelt (found on the Heroku website)
	-This installs an older ruby within it's directory.
	-It can install git if option selected (custom install option)

Install the following gems used to run the app on a local system with the same 
environment and configuration as it runs on Heroku.
	-foreman
	-taps

To start the local server:
	foreman start

If there are no errors, you can start the app locally at the urls:
	localhost:5000
	localhost:5000/admin



---------------------------
LOGGING INTO HEROKU WEBSITE
---------------------------
To log into heroku: 
	heroku login

You will be prompted for the email and password.

Note: You may be told the secret key is not found and asked if you want to generate it.
I generated it by entering 'yes'.  I also found that when I tried to log into Heroku
using a Git Bash screen, that it did not find this secret and would fail.  The normal
command window had no problem but that's the window I used to generate the secret so 
I'd suggest logging in the first time in the window type you plan to normally use.



------------------------------------------------
COMMITTING FILE CHANGES TO THE HEROKU DEPLOYMENT
------------------------------------------------
Use the normal Git commands to commit locally any files you intend to migrate up to Heroku.
You must be logged into Heroku before pushing changes to the platform.

To add files to deployment: 
	git add .

To commit changes with a comment: 
	git commit -m "A comment here"
	
To push files to the Heroku platform:
	git push heroku master

To make sure it deployed correctly on Heroku:
	heroku ps:scale web=1

Open the website either using the project url or using this command:
	heroku open

To run new migrations on Heroku:
	heroku run rake db:migrate
